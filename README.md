# Economic-Impact-of-Climate-Change-using-SQL-and-Tableau
This project analyses the economic impact of climate change with the help of climate data using SQL. The explorations are shown neatly in a dashboard prepared with the help of Tableau. 

## Data and Variables
The date-wise climate data for 7 countries (18 global cities) are taken for the years 2024 and 2025. <br>
Varibales such as Temperature, AQI, Precipitaiton, Extreme Weather Events, Economic Impact Estimate and Infrastructure Vulnerability are closely studied using both SQL and Tableau.

## Results and Observations
More than 8.6 million people are exposed and more than $ 987 millions in losses are accounted for from extreme weather. <br>
Despite moderate Infrastructure vulnerability, Montreal in Canada has the highest economic impact of around 37.8 billion dollars. Thus, we conclude that while improving infrastructure resilience is crucial, other factors like population exposure, emergency preparedness and climate adaptation also plays a significant role in mitigating economic damage due to climate change.
