# Economic-Impact-of-Climate-Change-using-SQL-and-Tableau
This project analyses the economic impact of climate change with the help of climate data using SQL. The explorations are shown neatly in a dashboard prepared with the help of Tableau. 
The date-wise climate data for 7 countries are taken for the years 2024 and 2025. 
Varibales such as Temperature, AQI, Precipitaiton, Extreme Weather Events, Economic Impact Estimate and Infrastructure Vulnerability are closely studied.
